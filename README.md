# WTCC-bot

The WTCC bot is a Discord bot which pulls information from Wake Tech's course descriptions and RateMyProfessors.com.

## Adding the Bot

Bot is currently in alpha, no link to add it directly will be provided at this time.

## Commands and Getting Started

When ready at release, the bot will take two slash commands, one for course descriptions and another for ratemyprofessors.com:

#### Examples

`/professor Harry Truman` will return results for the professor "Harry Truman" on RateMyProfessors.com 

`/course NET 125` will return results for the class known as NET-125 - Introduction to Networks

## TODO

- Add course descriptions search
- Add readme screenshot
