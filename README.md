# WTCC-bot

The WTCC bot is a Discord bot which pulls information from Wake Tech's course descriptions and RateMyProfessors.com.

## Commands

When ready at release, the bot will take two slash commands, one for course descriptions and another for ratemyprofessors.com.

#### Examples

`/professor Harry Truman` will return results for the professor "Harry Truman" on RateMyProfessors.com 

`/course NET 125` will return results for the class known as "NET-125 - Introduction to Networks"

## Adding the Bot

Bot is currently in Beta, no link to add it directly will be provided at this time. If you decide to use it in this stage, I won't be providing any support and you'll be using it at your own risk. Code is constantly being changed!

## TODO

- Add README screenshot
- Look into other features to add
